                    <p>From Consultant Manager to System Developer</p>
                </header>
                
                <p>I am currently studying the first year as a System Developer.NET at Campus in Varberg. C#, .NET, SQL, HTML, CSS. 
                    I will be in an internship from November 2024 to February 2025. <p>
        
                    Before starting my internship, I will have completed the following courses: Agile System Development in Teams, 
                    Advanced .NET, Advanced System Development with ASP.NET, Database Development and Administration, Object-Oriented Programming, 
                    System Testing for Frontend Developers, Web Development, and Development with C#. <p>
                    
                    Previously, I worked as a consultant manager at Lernia Bemanning. I had personnel and occupational health responsibilities for 40 
                    consultants who were leased to various companies in Varberg and Falkenberg. Tasks included managing contracts with clients, 
                    developing overall strategies, occupational health work, recruitment, labor union negotiations, and safety inspections with 
                    union representatives, among others.  <p>
                    
                    I consider myself a solution-oriented and communicative person. I am also accustomed to setting and pursuing both short-term and 
                    long-term goals. In addition to work and studies, most of my time is devoted to family and friends. <p>
                    
                    Best regards, Ermin Husic
